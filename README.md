This assignment is a about a fictional pharmaceutical company that tested skin cancer fighting drugs on a group of 250 mice.  The company, Pymaceuticals tested 10 drugs over 45 days. Our task was to measure changes in the tumor of 100 mice focusing on 4 drugs.  We created 4 visualizations; 3 scatter plots and 1 graph.

Ketapril was the least effective drug.  It performed about the same or even worse than the placebo in one instance.

Infubinol was similar to the placebo and Ketapril except in stopping the spread of cancer.  It seemed to control the spreading of metastatic sites almost as well as Capomulin.

If I were a dying mouse I would definitely ask for Capomulin.  The visualizations clearly show that Capomulin was the most effective drug of the 4 that we measured.  It was the only drug that reduced the tumor size over 45 days.  The tumor grew more than 45% using the other drugs and placebo.  In the Survival scatterplot you can see that over 80% of mice taking Capomulin were still alive versus fewer than 45% of mice using the other treatments.  From this study we can conclude that sick mice should ask their Veternarian if Capomulin is right for them.  We did not measure side effects so nothing can be concluded about that.
