This assignment is a about a fictional pharmaceutical company that tested skin cancer fighting drugs on a group of 250 mice.  The company, Pymaceuticals tested 10 drugs over 45 days. Our task was to measure changes in the tumor using 3 scatter plots and 1 graph.

Capomulin was the only effective drug of the 4 that we measured.  It reduced the tumor size 

Ketapril was the least effective drug.  It performed even worse than the placebo except for in survival during treatment.
